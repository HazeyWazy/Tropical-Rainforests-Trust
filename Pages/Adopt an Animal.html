								Adopt an Animal
							</h1>
							<h3>
								Animal Adoptions make fantastic gifts for all your friends and family.
							</h3>
							<p>
								Many rainforest animals are threatened by habitat loss and over-exploitation. Animal adoptions make a positive difference by supporting vital education and conservation work and by helping to ensure that the animals at The Living Rainforest receive the best care possible. Animal adoptions also help support our participation in international breeding programmes for threatened species.
							</p>
							<p>
								Some animals stay with us forever and depend on us for lifelong care because they are no longer able to fend for themselves. By adopting one or more of the permanent members of our family, you can help us keep them healthy, happy and safe and support our work rescuing and rehabilitating other animals too. In return, you'll become a special friend to an animal in need.

It took round the clock care and determination from our vets, but they never gave up and thankfully Gito survived.Your adoption today will help Gito on his road to recovery.

												From as little as 14p a day you can make a difference to the hundreds of bears we rescued from the misery of the dancing bear trade. Not only that, but you will be helping us fight the illegal wildlife trade, protecting wild bears from being snatched and sold for food, medicine and entertainment. Your support will make a real difference.

												Our primate rescue centre is set in Ciapus, on the island of Java. The centre is the only one in Indonesia to specialise in the rescue and rehabilitation of slow lorises. Our goal is to return as many slow lorises to the wild as possible. A number of lorises with their teeth intact have been released wearing radio collars and are being closely monitored by the team.
