								History
							</h1><hr>
							<h1>
								What We Do
							</h1>
							<p>
								Rainforest Trust purchases and protects the most threatened tropical forests, saving endangered wildlife through partnerships and community engagement.
							</p>
							<p>
								Through these highly effective partnerships, we can ensure sustainable results necessary for the long-term protection of tropical ecosystems and the wildlife they hold.
							</p><hr>
							<h1>
								How We Do It
							</h1>
							<p>
								Our unique, cost-effective conservation model for protecting endangered species has been implemented successfully for almost 30 years.
							</p>
							<p>
								We establish strategic partnerships with the world's most experienced and committed conservationists.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our partners' intimate knowledge of their regions' ecosystems and local communities is key to achieving long-term land and species protection.
							</p>
							<p>
								Together, we identify critical sites that provide a permanent refuge for endangered species. These biodiverse areas face immediate and direct threats, typically from loggers, miners or ranchers.
							</p>
							<p>
								Protection requires swift action, and we work with our partners to develop scientifically based conservation plans that are not only timely, but also resilient and sustainable. With detailed plans in place, we raise the funds necessary to implement them.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our partners work closely with their national governments and local communities to formally establish reserves protecting the land.
							</p>
							<h3>
								The creation of a new protected area is only the beginning.
							</h3>
							<p>
								We are committed to providing lasting, on-the-ground protection, which requires the ongoing support and participation of local communities. These communities are engaged through the creation of sustainable economic opportunities for local men and women, including training as forest guards, wildlife monitors and ecotourism guides.
							</p>
							<p>
								Thanks to the generosity of our donors, the expertise of our partners and the participation of local communities across the tropics, our reserves are exemplary models of international conservation.
							</p><hr>
							<h1>
								Conservation Projects
							</h1>
							<p>

								Rainforest Trust focuses on saving real acres of rainforest through land purchase and protection. Each of our projects has been identified as crucial to preserving critical habitat for endangered species. And with your help, we can save them now.
							</p>
							<h3>
								Proven track record of successfully saving rainforests around the world.
							</h3>
							<p>
								Since 1988, Rainforest Trust has been protecting threatened tropical habitats and endangered species in the most biodiverse areas of the world.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our collaborative conservation model is founded upon long-term strategic partnerships in host countries with the leaders of outstanding local conservation organizations. By partnering with people on the ground in the countries where we work, we help enable endangered species to rebound while providing education, training and economic assistance.
							</p>
							<p>
								We operate with the utmost efficiency, transparency and integrity, which helps ensure that 100% of all project donations are spent directly on conservation efforts. Rainforest Trust consistently receives the highest efficiency ratings from Charity Navigator and other independent charity evaluators, due to our exemplary standards of public accountability, program efficiency and cost effectiveness.
