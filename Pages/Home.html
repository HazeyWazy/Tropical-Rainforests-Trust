								Tropical rainforests are rainforests that occur in areas of tropical rainforest climate in which there is no dry season - all months have an average precipitation of at least 60 mm - and may also be referred to as lowland equatorial evergreen rainforest. True rainforests are typically found between 10 degrees north and south of the equator (see map); they are a sub-set of the tropical forest biome that occurs roughly within the 28 degree latitudes (in the equatorial zone between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn). Within the World Wildlife Fund's biome classification, tropical rainforests are a type of tropical moist broadleaf forest (or tropical wet forest) that also includes the more extensive seasonal tropical forests.

								Rainforest Trust, formerly World Land Trust-US and World Parks Endowment is a US-based nonprofit environmental organization established December 8, 1988 in New York. In 2006, then World Parks Endowment affiliated itself with World Land Trust, a UK-based nonprofit environmental organization, and became World Land Trust-US, as both organizations were dedicated to minimizing their costs in order to allow donated funds to flow to real habitat conservation projects on the ground. On September 16, 2013, as part of celebrating the organization's 25th anniversary, the World Land Trust-US changed its name to Rainforest Trust. Rainforest Trust is a world leader in the protection of tropical ecosystems and wildlife. We have protected millions of acres of rainforest from destruction while helping the world's most endangered species rebound and thrive.

								Rainforest Trust focuses on the purchase and protection of tropical lands that conserve threatened species, working across tropical Asia, Africa, and Latin America. For this purpose, it privately funds the purchase of large tracts of land by local NGO's for the purposes of protecting it, in a fashion similar to the Nature Conservancy by making use of land trusts. The organization also seeks to help in-situ conservation measures by providing training, capital and equipment for environmental stewardship in economically impoverished areas.
							</p>

							<p>
								Most acres are permanently protected for an average of less than $100 per acre. Since its founding, Rainforest Trust has saved and protected nearly 11,500,000 acres (47,000 km2) of tropical rainforest lands.

								Current President Robert S. Ridgely is an expert on neotropical birds, on which he has published several books, is a longtime conservationist, and is the co-discoverer of the jocotoco antpitta. CEO Paul Salaman/ is also a noted ornithologist and conservationist who has spent his life protecting the tropics. At 19 Paul discovered the choco vireo and sold the scientific naming rights for conservation purposes, raising $75,000. In 1998 Paul was a co-founder of Fundacion ProAves in Colombia, one of the most effective conservation organizations in South America.
